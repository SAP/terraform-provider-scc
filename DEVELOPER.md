# Development Setup

If you want to contribute to the Terraform provider for SAP Cloud Connector, be aware of the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) available in this repository.

ðŸš€ Heads-Up!

To get started, youâ€™ll need a running SAP Cloud Connector instance. If you havenâ€™t fired one up yet â€” no worries! Just cruise over to the [official setup guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/installation) and follow the steps to get connected.

First, you need to setup your development environment. The following sections describe the options that you have.

## Dev Container

> **Note**: In order to use dev containers, you must have a container runtime up and running on the machine. For details, we refer to the official documentation about [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

First, you must clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAP/terraform-provider-scc.git
```

Then open the cloned repository in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Within Visual Studio Code, press the "Open a remote Window" button in the lower left corner:

![screenshot of Visual Studio Code - Open a Remote Window](assets/VSCode_Show_Open_Remote_Window.png)

 Visual Studio Code will open the command palette. Choose the option "Reopen in Container":

![screenshot of Visual Studio Code - Open a Remote Window](assets/VSCode_Command_Palette_Reopen.png)

This will trigger the start of the dev container. You can choose to open a dev container with two configurations:

* "Terraform Provider for SAP Cloud Connector" - the configuration in [.devcontainer/default/devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/default/devcontainer.json) contains the development override for the Terraform provider so that the local build is used. You must set the environment variables `SCC_USERNAME`, `SCC_PASSWORD` and `SCC_INSTANCE_URL` yourself.
* Terraform Provider for SAP Cloud Connector - the configuration in [.devcontainer/withenvfile/devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/withenvfile/devcontainer.json) enhances the "Terraform provider for SAP Cloud Connector" to load environment variables (like username and password) when the container is started. This configuration expects a file called `devcontainer.env` in the folder `.devcontainer`.

> **Note**: `.env` files are excluded from git via `.gitignore`. You can use the file to store the environment variables `SCC_USERNAME`, `SCC_PASSWORD` and `SCC_INSTANCE_URL` that are needed when developing tests.

> **Note**: In the first run, the download of the container might take a while, so maybe time to grab a cup of coffee â˜•.

## Local Setup

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [go](https://go.dev/)
* [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

### MacOS (Homebrew)

If you run on MacOS, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to speed up the installation process:

```bash
brew install git golang golangci-lint make terraform
```

### Windows (Chocolatey)

Windows users can let [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) take over the installation for them:

```bash
choco install git golang golangci-lint make terraform
```

### Configuration of the Terraform CLI

Next you need to setup local development overrides in the Terraform CLI according to [this documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/debugging#terraform-cli-development-overrides). Once in place, Terraform will only consider local development builds for this provider.

Keep in mind that the [configuration file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file) location depends on your operating system:

* Mac/Linux/WSL: `~/.terraformrc`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%/terraform.rc`

The configuration should look similar to this:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "sap/scc" = "/path/to/go/bin" # the GOBIN directory can be found in the folder which `go env GOPATH` returns
  }

  direct {}
}
```

### Cloning of the Repository

The last step is then to clone the repository on your machine via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAP/terraform-provider-scc.git
```

Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.

## Install the Terraform Provider for SAP Cloud Connector Locally

Run the following command to build and install the provider:

```bash
make install
```

## Verify the Setup

Next, we verify that Terraform has access to your local build of the provider. Navigate to the folder `examples/provider/`:

```bash
cd examples/provider/
```

To verify the setup, execute the `terraform validate` command:

```bash
terraform validate
```

If the setup was successful you should see the following message:

```bash
â•·
â”‚ Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
â”‚
â”‚ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
â”‚  - sap/scc in /go/bin
â”‚
â”‚ The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published releases.
â•µ
Success! The configuration is valid, but there were some validation warnings as shown above.
```

In case of errors, please check first that you executed the previous steps correctly. If you are still stuck, feel free to ask for support by raising a [question](https://github.com/SAP/terraform-provider-scc/discussions/categories/q-a) in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SAP/terraform-provider-scc/discussions) of this repository.

> **Note**: Be aware that when using the development override you must not use the `terraform init`command. It is not necessary and may error unexpectedly.

## Howto Commit

Once you're done applying changes to the cloned repository, please ensure that the tests can still be executed (by running `make test`) and that the documentation is up to date (by executing `make generate`). Afterwards you're encouraged to open a pull-request to this repository. Please be aware that we're following the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which means the pull-request title has to be structured in a certain way:

* `fix: typo in the documentation`
* `feat: new resource xyz added`
* `refactor!: aligning schemas`
* `feat(scc_subaccount): a scoped feature`

For more examples, please have a look in the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
