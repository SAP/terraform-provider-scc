# Terraform Provider for SAP Cloud Connector

The Terraform Provider for SAP Cloud Connector allows users to manage and configure SAP Cloud Connector instances within SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform). It enables automation of connectivity between SAP BTP subaccounts and on-premise systems using Terraform.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    scc = {
        source = "sap/scc"
        version = "0.2.0-beta1"
    }
  }
}

provider "scc" {
  # Cloud Connector base URL, e.g., "https://localhost:8443"
  instance_url = "https://your-cloud-connector-instance:8443"

  # ❗ Authentication: Use **either** Basic Auth or Client Certificate Auth — not both

  # Option 1: Basic Authentication (set username and password)
  username = var.scc_username              # or set via SCC_USERNAME
  password = var.scc_password              # or set via SCC_PASSWORD (Sensitive)

  # Option 2: Certificate-based Authentication (set both client_certificate and client_key)
  # client_certificate = file("${path.module}/certs/client.crt")   # or SCC_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE
  # client_key         = file("${path.module}/certs/client.key")   # or SCC_CLIENT_KEY

  # TLS Server Verification
  ca_certificate = file("${path.module}/certs/ca.pem")             # or SCC_CA_CERTIFICATE
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `ca_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Contents of a PEM-encoded CA certificate used to verify the Cloud Connector server. Use `file("path/to/ca.pem")` in the provider block to load from a file. This can also be sourced from the `SCC_CA_CERTIFICATE` environment variable (useful when storing and retrieving secrets from secure stores).
- `client_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Contents of a PEM-encoded client certificate used for mutual TLS authentication. Use `file("path/to/cert.pem")` in the provider block to load from a file. This can also be sourced from the `SCC_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` environment variable (useful when storing and retrieving secrets from secure stores).
- `client_key` (String, Sensitive) Contents of a PEM-encoded client private key used for mutual TLS authentication. Use `file("path/to/key.pem")` in the provider block to load from a file. This can also be sourced from the `SCC_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable (useful when storing and retrieving secrets from secure stores).
- `instance_url` (String) The URL of the Cloud Connector instance. This can also be sourced from the `SCC_INSTANCE_URL` environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password used for Basic Authentication with the Cloud Connector instance. This can also be sourced from the `SCC_PASSWORD` environment variable (useful when storing and retrieving secrets from secure stores).
- `username` (String) The username used for Basic Authentication with the Cloud Connector instance. This can also be sourced from the `SCC_USERNAME` environment variable (useful when storing and retrieving secrets from secure stores).
